# Underwriting Dashboard Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the issues that were identified and fixed in the Underwriting Dashboard application.

## 1. Column Name Mapping Issue

**Problem:** Dashboard wasn't displaying data due to a mismatch between column names in the dashboard (using spaces) and database (using underscores).

**Solution:** Implemented column name mapping to convert between naming conventions consistently.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/dashboard/utils/data_processing_fix.py`

## 2. Database Connection Path Issues

**Problem:** Received error "no such table: underwriting_model_data" due to path differences between WSL and Windows environments.

**Solution:** Created a fix script that establishes correct database paths and improves cursor handling.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/database/db_manager_fixed.py`
- `fix_database_path.py`

## 3. Environment Variable Issues

**Problem:** Encountered error "ValueError: Required path environment variable DEALS_ROOT not set"

**Solution:** Updated settings.py to handle missing environment variables with appropriate defaults.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/config/settings.py`
- Created launch scripts with environment variables properly set

## 4. Data Type Conversion Issues

**Problem:** Encountered PyArrow data type conversion error: "Could not convert '[Year Built]' with type str: tried to convert to double"

**Solution:** Created data processing fix that properly handles mixed data types.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/dashboard/utils/data_processing_fix.py`

## 5. Nested Expanders Issue

**Problem:** Error in Analytics tab: "Error rendering city analysis: Expanders may not be nested inside other expanders"

**Solution:** Removed nested expanders in the analytics component and replaced with tabs and direct display of data.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/dashboard/components/analytics_fix.py`
- `src/dashboard/app.py`
