# Database Performance Improvements

This document details the database optimizations implemented in the Underwriting Dashboard project.

## Connection Pooling

- **Implementation**: Connection pooling was implemented in `db_manager_optimized.py` to reuse database connections.
- **Benefits**: Significantly reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each query.
- **Key Components**:
  - Reuse of existing connections rather than creating new ones for each query
  - Auto-reconnect functionality when connections are lost
  - Proper connection cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Query Caching

- **Implementation**: LRU (Least Recently Used) caching was added for frequently executed queries.
- **Benefits**: Dramatically speeds up repeated queries by avoiding database round-trips.
- **Key Components**:
  - Configurable cache size and expiration
  - Cache invalidation strategy for modified data
  - Function-level caching with the `@lru_cache` decorator for database operations

## Batch Operations

- **Implementation**: Added support for batch inserts, updates, and deletes.
- **Benefits**: Significantly improves performance when operating on multiple rows.
- **Key Components**:
  - Batched SQL operations using executemany()
  - Transaction management for atomic operations
  - Configurable batch sizes

## Database Indexing

- **Implementation**: Added automatic index creation and management.
- **Benefits**: Faster query execution, especially for filtered and sorted results.
- **Key Components**:
  - Automatic index creation for commonly queried columns
  - Index detection to prevent duplicate indexes
  - SQL index optimization

## WAL Mode

- **Implementation**: Enabled Write-Ahead Logging mode for SQLite.
- **Benefits**: Improves concurrency and write performance.
- **Key Components**:
  - Configuration in database initialization
  - Proper journal mode settings
  - Synchronization control for optimal performance

## Column Name Mapping

- **Implementation**: Created a mapping system to handle column name inconsistencies.
- **Benefits**: Fixes issues with dashboard filters and display due to naming differences.
- **Key Components**:
  - Mapping between dashboard column names (with spaces) and database column names (with underscores)
  - Filter translation in the dashboard service
  - Support for the database's naming quirks (e.g., "Propety" instead of "Property")

## Cursor Handling

- **Implementation**: Improved cursor management throughout the database operations.
- **Benefits**: Prevents issues with stale or closed cursors, improving reliability.
- **Key Components**:
  - Proper cursor creation and closing
  - Error handling for cursor operations
  - Automatic cursor refresh when needed

## Prepared Statement Caching

- **Implementation**: Added caching for prepared SQL statements.
- **Benefits**: Reduces SQL parsing overhead and improves query performance.
- **Key Components**:
  - Statement preparation and reuse
  - Parameterized queries for security and efficiency
  - Statement invalidation on schema changes

## Testing

- **Implementation**: Created test scripts to verify database operations.
- **Benefits**: Ensures reliability and helps identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Key Components**:
  - Unit tests for database functions
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Data integrity verification
