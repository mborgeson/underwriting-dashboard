# Underwriting Dashboard Architectural Improvements

This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to the Underwriting Dashboard project.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Python Package Structure

- Added `__init__.py` files throughout the project to establish proper Python package structure
- Created a centralized imports initialization in `src/setup.py`
- Fixed import issues in dashboard components to ensure they work with Streamlit

### 2. Configuration Management

- Created flexible configuration system in `src/config/settings.py`
- Implemented environment variable support using python-dotenv
- Added `.env` and `.env.template` files for configuration
- Made paths relative and environment-aware instead of hard-coded

### 3. Service Layer

- Implemented service layer to separate business logic from data access and presentation:
  - `FileService` for file processing logic
  - `DashboardService` for dashboard data operations
  - `MonitoringService` for file monitoring

### 4. Import Fixes for Streamlit

- Added import fixes to all dashboard components to ensure they can find modules correctly
- Created `streamlit_run.py` script to properly set the PYTHONPATH
- Added convenient `run_dashboard.bat` and `run_dashboard.sh` scripts
- Updated `main.py` to use the new service layer structure

## Running the Application

The application can now be run in several ways:

1. **Main Application with Monitoring**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Dashboard Only**:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     run_dashboard.bat
     ```
   - On Mac/Linux:
     ```
     ./run_dashboard.sh
     ```
   - Using Python directly:
     ```
     python streamlit_run.py
     ```

## Next Steps

The following improvements are planned for future phases:

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Improve query performance
   - Add proper indexing
   - Implement connection pooling

2. **Excel Processing Improvements**
   - Add parallel processing for Excel files
   - Cache results for better performance
   - Optimize memory usage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement centralized error handling
   - Add better logging
   - Create error recovery mechanisms

## Configuration

To configure the application, copy `.env.template` to `.env` and edit the settings:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file to set your specific paths and preferences.

## Structure Changes

The new project structure separates concerns better:

```
├── src/
│   ├── config/         # Configuration management
│   ├── dashboard/      # UI components
│   ├── database/       # Database access
│   ├── data_processing/ # Data extraction logic
│   ├── file_monitoring/ # File system monitoring
│   └── services/       # Business logic layer
├── .env                # Environment-specific configuration
├── .env.template       # Template for configuration
└── run_dashboard.py    # Dashboard runner script
```

This structure improves maintainability, testability, and clarity, making it easier to extend and modify in the future.
